# Tensorflow Pipeline

An framework built to be a component in a pipeline of data processing using `Tensorflow`.

Note that this repo is a pipeline framework only and the model construction
itself is *not* in it: model will be dynamically loaded to the pipeline
according to the path defined in the `config.json` file.
